# The Huddle: A Quantitative Playground

The concept of the Huddle is to explore the topic of quantitative analytics. `Happiness Enterprises` aims to give
back to the community, and we hope you do the same. The license is the Apache 2.0 license, because we felt that
even though we want the community to cooperate, sometimes it is necessary to keep secret some things. However, we still
believe people deserve to know _**what**_ it is that you are doing, and so any major changes you make must at least
be documented.

A large portion of this repertoire will be geared towards predictive analytics. Not everything, of course, will be in
that camp, and of those things that are, some will be more predictive than others.

Over time, we hope that you will share back. Let's make this community great!
