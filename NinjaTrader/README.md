# NinjaTrader

Everything in this directory is related to the NinjaTrader (NT) platform. Specifically, everything as of the date of
this writing is for NinjaTrader 8.1.2.4 (NT8) or later. Some of the code may run on earlier versions of NT8, but none
of this code has been tested on those earlier versions.

## Layout and Usage

The directory layout follows that of NT8. To make use of any of the code here, just copy it directly into your NT8
code folder and reference it from your `NinjaTrader.Custom.csproj` project file. For now, only a set of `Indicators`
exist.
